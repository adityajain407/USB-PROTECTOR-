# USB-PROTECTOR
TPYE C AND TYPE A USB DUST PROTECTOR. AS WE SAW IN OUR NAS SYSTEM THERE ARE SOME UNUSED USB PORT WITH GET DAMAGE VIA DUST HUMIDITY. AND I AM SURE YOU ALSO FACE IT. 

-so my plan to build a dummy usd which can be plug on unused port of nas and server. even this can protect any usb port of any device.
