# USB-PROTECTOR
TPYE C AND TYPE A USB DUST PROTECTOR. AS WE SAW IN OUR NAS SYSTEM THERE ARE SOME UNUSED USB PORT WITH GET DAMAGE VIA DUST HUMIDITY. AND I AM SURE YOU ALSO FACE IT. 
-so my plan to build a dummy usd which can be plug on unused port of nas and server. even this can protect any usb port of any device.

So here is my third design-

so why it final design ?
- after printing i found that there is no problem to plug as in 1st and 2nd have but the outer part is very thin which made it diffucult it plug out
